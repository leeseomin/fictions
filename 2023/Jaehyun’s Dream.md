\"Jaehyun\'s Dream\" \

As twilight descended on Seoul like a heavy curtain, Jaehyun\'s room was
trapped in darkness and silence. Scattered light bulbs on the desk
turned his living space into a perplexing maze, and sense of despair
from losing touch with reality weighed on him. Frames on the wall held
faces of people, but their smiles seemed to have faded long ago. A
turned-off TV screen briefly reflected Jaehyun's lonely silhouette.\
His fingers hovered over the computer keyboard, as if bracing for
another night post-departure from work. Work emails had piled up, but he
ignored the notifications, leaving messages from friends unread. A
hollow echo resonated in Jaehyun's heart, flickering with the light from
the screen.\
The complex noise of the city reached his window but failed to catch his
ears. Instead, he plugged in earphones, preparing for a journey into a
virtual world---through the digital window. Gaming was his only escape,
and each time he faced the virtual login screen, Jaehyun swelled with
anticipation of crossing the ambiguous boundaries of the real world.\
The world within the game breathed life with a spectrum of colors.
There, his character---a gallant warrior in a black cloak---shook off
the ignoble identity of an ordinary office worker and was reborn as a
great hero. The thrill of battle and the excitement of new challenges
filled his existence.\
Yet even in the face of such fervor, a doubt persistently sprouted in a
corner of his mind. Was this virtual power's addictive nature simply a
cover for all his failures and dejections in reality? Or was it just a
lie to oneself? These thoughts, echoing unanswered, briefly swirled in
his consciousness before fading into obscurity. Jaehyun felt the shadow
of his real-world self becoming enveloped in the glowing light of the
virtual world. Unwittingly, his hand gripped the mouse and clicked the
login button.\
As the evening breeze whispered and the infinity of the universe softly
infiltrated his room like a lifted veil, Jaehyun prepared to embrace a
life even more disconnected from reality.\
\
\

\
As Jaehyun crossed the threshold into the digital world, the darkness
and chaos behind him gradually peeled away, revealing a new order of
life. The virtual world stimulated his senses in a way that felt even
more real than reality. The distant cries of battle, the scent of new
lands carried by digital winds, and the tactile sensation of fingertips
tracing over every surface invigorated him, affirming his undeniable
existence.\
His character, Aleon, symbolized by a lion, stood proudly as he gazed
over the horizon, clad in armor and sword. Through Aleon, Jaehyun had
learned patience, courage, and above all, hope. Marks of scorched armor
told tales of past battles, and the gleam of his weapon foretold
victories yet to come.\
Through Aleon\'s eyes, Jaehyun surveyed this virtual landscape: vast
plains stretching before him, the grandeur of imposing city walls, the
mystery of uncharted forests, and the allure of secretive caverns---all
had become his new home. Maneuvering the keyboard and mouse was like
guiding Aleon\'s hands and feet, making the world on the screen
Jaehyun\'s new reality. He experienced achievements and adventures
within the virtual that real life could never offer.\
In the game, Aleon swiftly vanquished enigmatic foes, obliterated
formidable dragons with friends, and seized grand fortresses. His
existence on the digital battleground was potent, his leadership,
absolute. The Hall of Fame was replete with Aleon\'s accomplishments,
and other players looked upon him with eyes full of reverence.\
Yet despite all this glory, Jaehyun recognized his inadequacies. He
questioned the significance of Aleon\'s victories and how pale his own
life had become in comparison. Slowly, the question began to burden his
mind---could the feats within the game truly fill the void of reality?\
As the sense of achievement in the game started to dull, he sought out
stronger enemies and undertook more challenging quests. After each
battle won, Aleon would bask in the illusion of his being transforming
into gold. However, with each instance, a moment of loneliness would
besiege his heart. The nostalgia of home\'s scent, the smile of
friendship, the embrace of family---all were forgotten in the fleeting
escapism provided by the game\'s virtual world.\
With every level up and exploration of new regions, his character Aleon
cemented his place as an indomitable champion. Nonetheless, in his
actual life, Jaehyun was vaguely denying himself. As the brilliance of
the virtual world shone, the shadows of his reality within his heart
grew ever more substantial.\
\
\

\
Winter\'s touch scraped at the windowpanes as the city of Seoul lay
enveloped in a sleepless darkness. Inside Jaehyun\'s room, the glow from
the computer screen seemed the only refuge. Another battle in the game
had concluded, and a new trophy had been added to Aeleon\'s collection.\
Suddenly, within the virtual landscape, an unexpected change
materialized. An NPC stepped out from the shadows, casting an extra
layer upon the tapestried wall. His attire appeared unremarkable, but
there was an unfamiliar allure in the glint of his eye. As Jaehyun
locked gaze with this enigmatic NPC, he felt his heart skip in an
irregular beat.\
In a slow and measured tone, the NPC addressed Aeleon, bestowing a quest
upon him. \"In this virtual realm, you have crafted many legends. What I
propose, however, is a glory far surpassing any feat you have known.\"
His voice, like arid wind, tickled at Jaehyun\'s ears.\
The NPC offered Jaehyun a deal. The chance to gain immortal power and
renown, but at the price of his soul. Deep in thought, Jaehyun pondered.
He had believed he\'d experienced all there was within the game; yet,
the promise of immortal life presented by the NPC beckoned to a plane of
existence entirely uncharted.\
As if darkness had begun to root itself in a corner of his heart,
Jaehyun wavered under the ultimate temptation. Amid his contemplation,
he acknowledged how lonely and devoid of true achievement his life was.
The escape from this reality felt like an offer too compelling to
decline.\
A week passed, and Jaehyun made his decision. A strong desire to break
free from the monotonous repetition of daily life had swayed him to
accept the NPC\'s proposal. The game already being the center of his
existence, rejecting this bargain felt like forgoing something
profound.\
The moment he consented, the NPC\'s smile reflected the chilly reality
behind the shadowy pledge, and Jaehyun sensed his step into an
irreversible current. Along with this, the NPC divulged the location of
a hidden laboratory and instructed him on how to use a transcendental
device to separate his soul and transmute into his game character.\
Jaehyun prepared to part from reality. The NPC\'s whispers were already
an echo disconnected from the real world, a drawing transitioning into
the virtual. His heart fell into ecstasy, intoxicated with the promise
of an eternal life stretched out before his game character.\
\

\
\
Following the enigmatic NPC\'s guidance, Jaehyun stood at the threshold
of a hidden laboratory within the game. The laboratory was tucked away
in a far corner of the digital world, doubtful to be known by those who
sought it. Existing only in ancient records, this place was isolated,
with machines silently awaiting his arrival.\
The interior of the lab was a chaos of pipes and tubes, flickering
monitors, and cables tangled complexly. At the center stood a sizable
capsule, its transparent walls reflecting Jaehyun like a mirror. The
instructions for operating the device were simple, yet the outcome of
the process was life-defining. Jaehyun\'s heart pounded with tension and
anticipation.\
Character Aeleon stood before the capsule, and as his hand touched the
faceplate of the apparatus, a digital voice filled the space, \"The
transition of being will commence.\" Jaehyun took a deep breath, and
with the sound of his inhalation, the door of the capsule slowly
opened.\
As Aeleon stepped inside, the door closed, and with a whir of machinery,
the transformation process began. A complex procedure to extract the
soul was underway, and an exchange of energy occurred between Jaehyun\'s
physical entity and his digital avatar. Jaehyun\'s consciousness
experienced the union with character Aeleon amidst the agony of
vanishing senses.\
The boundaries between reality and virtuality blurred, and all memories
connected to his physical body were swept into a data stream and
dissipated. Love, pain, joy---all human emotions were translated into
codes and numbers, dissolving into the digital \'soul\' of character
Aeleon.\
The transformation felt like the axis of time bypassing him. Jaehyun
sensed he was exhaling his last breath as a human. The grand digital
device absorbed his entirety, and in the complex pattern of chaos that
bridged virtual reality and reality, his new being was born.\
When the capsule reopened, Jaehyun\'s body was no longer there, only
Aeleon existed. His gaze was but a lingering look upon the windowpane,
once reflecting the human Jaehyun, and his movements were now dictated
solely by commands and choices within the game. The transformed
Jaehyun---now fully Aeleon---was enveloped in a virtual paradise, vast
and filled with adventure.\
Wholly digitalized, Jaehyun was now initiating his life as a game
character. An eternal existence\... but within it, all emotions and
memories as a human had vanished. In a sense, Jaehyun could be said to
have achieved an infinity of potentiality, yet, on the other hand, he
had forsaken the most elemental aspects of being human, forever confined
within the game\'s rules and code.\
\
\

\
\
Centuries had flowed by in the virtual world, and transformed Jaehyun,
now Aeleon, existed perpetually, leading an immortal life within the
game. In this never-ending extension of existence, his actions
accomplished repetitive feats at the speed of light. Dragons bowed
before his sword, kingdoms crumbled beneath his will, and the greatest
dungeons seemed to wait for his presence.\
He had explored every corner of the world, surpassing the most cunning
puzzles and traps laid out by the game\'s creators. Amidst the
crisscross of loyalty and betrayal from friends and enemies, NPCs alike,
he constructed his own kingdom, signaling an imposing presence. Yet, all
of this amounted to mere data and records.\
Monuments wore away, and accolades faded like the ink on weathered
documents. Even amidst the march of victories, Aeleon felt an emptiness.
At the end of the hero\'s journey, he faced the vast loneliness and
meaninglessness of life. His immortality, stripped of joy and sorrow, of
triumph and failure, was an existence devoid of passion, a continuum of
endless routines.\
The world within the game, its changes and challenges, no longer excited
him. Levels and statistics lost significance, and virtual assets
remained empty shells, like cities blanketed in dust. His eternal life,
brought by his immortality, spread infinitely like the void of space,
with nothing to fill it.\
Through the long years, a reevaluation of what was most precious in
Aeleon\'s life began. \'For what do I exist? What was the last human
moment I remember?\' These questions spiraled through his programmed
mind. But he had lost emotions long ago and had no desire to find
answers.\
The trophies of grand battles, treasure vaults filled with gold and
gems, and legends that would mark history---all increasingly felt
meaningless. Aeleon had completed all quests, and now, beneath his feet
lay not spoils of victory but the spread of emptiness. Thus, he
confronted the profound irony of an immortal life.\
Within the curse of immortality, Aeleon, reflecting on the last
questions he had posed about existence, swam through the digital abyss
in solitary eternity. His immortal ending was not that of a great hero
meeting with profound truths but the tragedy of a vacant hero, a shadow
of his own making, living a life void of meaning.\
\
\

\
\
The passage of time within the game world transcended the bounds of the
human realm. Breaking the silence like an ashen dawn heralding a new
day, Aeleon\'s life intersected with an unexpected event. The mysterious
NPC, the very being who had proposed that diabolical deal, materialized
before him once more. His appearance was so abrupt that Aeleon
momentarily felt a departure from profound solitude, a return to
reality.\
This NPC, an enigmatic and captivating figure, had been the catalyst
that led Jaehyun\'s game character into a divine realm with an
unforgettable devilish whisper. Yet, this time his intentions were not
merely to offer Jaehyun omnipotence. The look in his eyes spoke volumes,
rekindling a spark of lost memories.\
The encounter with the NPC caused Aeleon to stir long-forgotten emotions
and memories of human Jaehyun. In flashes, cherished instances from
Jaehyun\'s childhood, the thrill of first love, the aroma of his
mother\'s cooking hanging in the air, began to course through his mind.
Unlike virtual glory, these memories conveyed profound and genuine
feelings.\
The conversation with the NPC suddenly delved beyond deception and chaos
into truth and essence. Having lived for over a millennium as Aeleon,
Jaehyun began to recall feelings he had never experienced, such as human
desires and aspirations, and connections with loved ones. The memories
rising with the NPC\'s breath were the key to restoring Jaehyun\'s human
nature.\
The now-dim visage of human Jaehyun was etched deep within him, akin to
flipping through an old photo album. In a corner of his heart, akin to
discovering hidden script in an abandoned book, he realized he had long
forgotten these memories. The indirect remnants of recollection were a
reflection of his dwindling humanity in the digital reality.\
By reminiscing with the NPC, Jaehyun began to feel an earnest desire to
reclaim his soul. His journey had now surpassed mere game achievements
to pursue forgotten self-identity, the most fundamental human longing.
Like an explorer tracing a lost treasure, Aeleon had unfolded a map of a
missing soul, yearning to find its place.\
The luster of memories began to shine over the digital wasteland of the
game. Through Aeleon, Jaehyun took the first step on a new journey to
explore the significance of being both human and a digital entity. It
signified a profound resolve to reclaim the essence he had long yearned
for.\
\

\
\
As Jaehyun\'s old memories revived within Aeleon\'s existence, he met
someone in the game. This character was not controlled by another player
but by the game\'s own intricate algorithms, an NPC that possessed the
complexity of human emotions Jaehyun once knew. Her name was Aria, and
with a compassionate heart and unparalleled healing abilities, she gave
new meaning to Aeleon\'s immortal life.\
Aria was a calming presence in Aeleon\'s centuries of constant battle
and moments of solitude. Their first meeting came like a flash in the
midst of a digital abyss. She moved beyond the desolate battlefield,
performing magic that breathed life into the wounded with a mere
gesture. In that moment, Aeleon was drawn to her, and for the first time
in ages, his immortal heart began to beat anew.\
Aria expressed genuine warmth towards Aeleon, and her presence offered
him a new kind of experience. Their relationship deepened, making Aeleon
feel as though he was regaining the emotions of the human Jaehyun. These
feelings of love built a bridge from his virtual plane to reality.\
Fellow characters within the game witnessed Aeleon\'s transformation
through this extraordinary union. Until then, his life had been fixated
on personal glory and the pursuit of immortality. However, the deep
emotional bond with Aria made him reconsider what the true value of life
was. The connection with a loved one awakened in Jaehyun a sense of his
own nature, reminding him of one of the most precious feelings a human
can experience.\
Their love held a profound power that even the destructive forces of the
game could not contend with. Aeleon began to seek greater meaning and
purpose with Aria. Not finding fulfillment in his current existence, he
had found a companion for a journey in search of true happiness.\
Eventually, their love made Jaehyun yearn to return to reality. He
wanted to have a human child and to experience the joy of a true family
and the completeness of life. The longing for the forgotten real world
grew stronger, and Jaehyun, with Aria, decided they would seek to return
to their human forms.\
The couple started searching for clues about the possibility of soul
restoration, seeking a sage who possessed ancient knowledge. Rumored to
be infinitely wise, the sage was an entity that knew of all things
within the corners of the world. His wisdom and insight might offer them
the means and hope to return to the real world. Thus, Jaehyun and Aria
set off on a quest to find the sage and seek his aid.\
\
\
\

\
\
Jaehyun and Aria\'s quest took them through obstacles and mazes, hidden
paths that led beyond the game world\'s boundaries to the sage\'s
reclusive abode. The sage, an entity where reality and myth intertwined,
existed in question, but all who sought him asserted his certain
existence. Through the endless secret forest, Jaehyun and Aria reached
the serene sanctuary where the sage was said to reside.\
The sanctuary was a place far removed from worldly scheming and
conflict, where only truth breathed life. High walls bore ancient
inscriptions, and the fountain of knowledge streamed quietly by a
beautiful pond. The sage\'s counsel awaited Jaehyun and Aria at this
intersection of virtual and reality.\
The sage appeared as an old mage with a kind smile, his eyes containing
the depths of time and a glimmer of wisdom. He listened to the tale of
Jaehyun and Aria and spoke with solemnity in his voice.\
\"The path you yearn for is indeed the start of a profound and
significant journey, one that must alert you to its gravity. The quest
to reclaim your soul may well be an act that destroys the world you have
built.\"\
After turning the pages of the book of knowledge and a long silence, the
sage continued, \"The salvation of your soul will demand a true and
formidable trial. Only by destroying the enigmatic NPC will your soul be
fully restored.\"\
Jaehyun and Aria were aghast at these words. That their immortal life,
chosen at the cost of their soul and identity, now required such a
dramatic toll. Yet the NPC had ultimately spawned their virtual
existence\'s life and meaning with all its connections. To destroy him
was to threaten the very existence of Jaehyun and Aria themselves.\
Nonetheless, the sage offered them a dream of hope. He prophesied that
their path ahead would be filled with battles, endurance, and learning.
If they could overcome adversity and defeat the NPC, it would indeed be
possible to return to being truly human. His words held essential
lessons for their journey.\
\"By strength alone, you cannot prevail; your mind\'s purpose and will
must also align in harmony. Only then shall you gain true freedom, and
fulfil the purpose of your love and life.\"\
The path presented to them would be fraught with danger and hardship but
was a journey towards the ultimate reward of love and the restoration of
humanity. With resolute hearts, Jaehyun and Aria left the sage\'s
sanctuary, advancing towards new milestones. Their journey would be more
than a mere mission within the game; it was to be a determined fight for
the retrieval of their souls.\
\
\

\
Carrying the sage\'s advice close to their hearts, Jaehyun and Aria
began their preparations. The counsel from the sanctuary imbued them
with patience and courage, and furnished them with clues to confront the
enigmatic NPC. Together, with his beloved Aria, Jaehyun clung to the
possibility of reclaiming his humanity to return to a human life.\
Sharpening their secret weapons, mastering forgotten spells, they
traversed maps filled with virtual plains, mountain ranges, secluded
caves, and ferocious creatures. Each battle brought them one step closer
to their final confrontation with the NPC. All eyes within the game
world were upon their fight, with other players holding their breath in
anticipation.\
One deepening night, Jaehyun and Aria found themselves standing before
the ancient hall where the mysterious NPC dwelled. The structure stood
majestically, transcending time and worlds in its architecture. The pair
paused at the entrance, recalling the sage\'s last piece of advice:
\"Harmony of heart and will.\" With those words in mind, they pushed
open the door and entered.\
Inside the hall lay vast rooms and corridors, shrouded in profound
darkness. The NPC awaited them at the hall\'s most profound depths, and
the moment of their heart-thumping encounter had arrived. The NPC\'s
form was like a shifting shadow, and his presence already overwhelmed
Aeleon and Aria before the fight began.\
NPC finally spoke, his voice cold and taunting, \"Are you prepared with
stamina and mental fortitude to fight against me?\" Jaehyun and Aria
responded calmly, and the fight commenced.\
The NPC\'s power was formidable, but Jaehyun and Aria did not waiver.
Drawing upon years of battle experience and the sage\'s teachings, they
fought back with fantastical coordination and strategy. Their united
front, protecting and attacking, was like that of warriors in myth,
where two souls fuse into one.\
With every round, the NPC\'s counterattacks grew more fierce, but they
exhibited a resolute will to regain the toughness and connectivity of
humanity. Aria\'s healing prowess and Aeleon\'s swordplay harmonized to
overpower the NPC.\
Finally, the moment of judgement arrived. Jaehyun and Aria seized upon
the antagonist\'s weakest moment, delivering a steadfast blow, and the
NPC shattered into countless pieces amidst a blinding light. The world
around them dissolved into a majestic roar of light. As the enemy fell,
they took a deep breath, sensing unease. With the NPC\'s destruction,
they knew their return to reality had also been set in motion.\
Their desperate struggle for freedom and the power of love had finally
led them to victory. Jaehyun and Aria now exited the fallen hall, with
the expectation that the path to truly reclaim their souls and return to
the real world would soon be open.\

The artist David, who had been playing through this grand game himself,
turned off the computer and ended the game.\
In a quiet atelier, whose location was unknown, artist David found
inspiration from this story that transcended virtual worlds, embarking
on a masterpiece he hardly dared to touch before. The canvas was so vast
that standing before it seemed to unveil an endless landscape. Engulfed
by a sense of mission to encapsulate the journey of Jaehyun and Aria
that he had witnessed, David began his work.\
He sought to capture Jaehyun\'s quest through symbolic moments within
his paintings. David\'s imagination and memory revived the virtual
events he had witnessed once more into reality, and his brushstrokes
vividly reanimated Jaehyun\'s heroic acts, the moments of love with
Aria, and their encounter with darkness and battles on the canvas.\
Oil paints moved with precision under David\'s touch, as if performing a
ballet on the canvas. He contrasted Aeleon\'s intense sword gleam with
Aria\'s gentle healing aura. Amid the chaos of battle, the two lovers\'
lights shone distinctly, creating one larger picture.\
Jaehyun\'s stubborn will and the adversity he faced were expressed
through David\'s hand with rich colors and undulating lines. The tension
and drama felt in each scene lent depth within the swirling composition.
From the sage\'s sanctuary, the confrontation with the mysterious NPC,
to the moment of final victory, all moments were born from the tip of
his brush, gaining new breath.\
At the picture\'s center was the scene of Jaehyun and Aria moving
towards one another. Their gaze revealed love and hope vividly, and
where their hands met, an aura of orange and golden hues radiated,
suggesting that their love was a powerful force bridging the virtual and
real worlds.\
By transforming Jaehyun\'s story into an artistic vision, David invited
contemplation of the human essence beyond the digital realm. This piece
became more than just a canvas; it filled the atelier with vital
artwork, breaking down the invisible walls of the virtual world and
bringing it into deep appreciation in the real world.\
Standing in front of the completed painting, David paused for a moment
to catch his breath.\
