Scene #1

Once upon a time, in a remote village nestled among the mountains, there lived a fisherman named Wei. Wei was a simple man who made a modest living by fishing in the nearby river. One day, as Wei was walking along the riverbank, he saw a large fish swimming near the surface. The fish was unlike any Wei had ever seen before. Its scales were a shimmering gold, and its eyes seemed to glow like precious gems.

Wei knew that this fish was special, and he knew that he had to catch it. He spent the next several days setting traps and casting his net in the river, but the golden fish remained elusive. Wei grew increasingly frustrated, and he began to lose hope that he would ever catch the fish.

One day, as Wei was sitting by the river, he noticed an old man sitting nearby. The old man had a serene expression on his face, and he seemed to be lost in thought. Wei approached the old man and asked him what he was thinking about.

“I am waiting for Codot,” replied the old man.

“Who is Codot?” asked Wei.

“Codot is a fish that swims in the river of life,” said the old man. “It is said that those who catch Codot will gain great wisdom and understanding.”

Wei was intrigued by the old man’s words. He asked the old man how he could catch Codot.

“You cannot catch Codot by chasing after it,” said the old man.

“The quest for wisdom,
Endless searching in the dark,
A moth to the flame.

Enlightenment’s grasp,
A burden that weighs heavy,
Like chains on the soul.

But be like the butterfly,
Fluttering free and untamed,
Embrace the unknown.

For in the journey,
We find the answers we seek,
In the endless flight.”

Wei pondered the old man’s words for a moment, and then he realized the truth behind them. He realized that he had been so focused on catching the golden fish that he had lost sight of the bigger picture. He had forgotten that the true value of fishing was not in catching a single fish, but in the experience of being in nature and observing the world around him.

Wei thanked the old man for his wisdom and returned to his fishing. He cast his net into the river and waited, enjoying the sound of the water and the beauty of the mountains. And then, as if by magic, the golden fish appeared in his net. Wei marveled at its beauty, but he did not feel the need to keep it. Instead, he released it back into the river and watched as it swam away.

As Wei returns to his humble abode, he succumbs to a deep slumber, only to find himself living a life beyond his own as a character known as Gene within the realm of his subconscious.

Scene #2

The setting is a barren wasteland of a land that was once known as Spain. The sun blazes down with an unrelenting heat that seems to only add to the sense of desolation that permeates everything.

The scene opens on two figures, Gene and David, as they trudge across the landscape. They are dressed in rags, and their faces are covered in grime and dirt.

Gene: “What do you think happened here, David?”

David: “I don’t know, Gene. It looks like some sort of nuclear war, maybe?”

Gene: “Yes, it does. But what does it matter? The world is over. We are the only ones left.”

David: “It’s a lonely existence, isn’t it?”

Gene: “Yes, it is. But at least we have each other.”

David: “Do you think we will ever find anyone else?”

Gene: “I don’t know, David. But we can’t give up hope. We have to keep moving forward.”

David: “But where are we going, Gene?”

Gene: “I don’t know that either, David. But as long as we keep moving, maybe we’ll find something. Maybe we’ll find someone.”

The two figures trudge on, their footsteps echoing in the emptiness around them. The sun beats down mercilessly, and the world seems like a vast, empty desert. But still, they keep moving, driven by an unexplainable hope that somewhere, somehow, they will find something that will give meaning to their existence.

Scene #3

The sun begins to set, casting long shadows across the barren landscape. Gene and David come across a small pond, the water murky and still.

David: “Gene, can we rest here for a while?”

Gene nods, and they sit down by the edge of the pond. They dip their hands in the water, feeling the coolness of it against their skin.

Gene: “Do you ever think about what life was like before all of this?”

David: “Sometimes. But it feels like another world, another lifetime.”

Gene: “Yes, it does. But we can’t forget who we were before. We have to hold onto our humanity, even in the face of all of this destruction.”

David: “What does it mean to be human, Gene? In a world like this?”

Gene: “I don’t know, David. But maybe it means to still seek out companionship, even when it seems impossible. To still hold onto hope, even when all seems lost. To still find dignity in our suffering.”

David: “But how do we find companionship when we are the only ones left?”

Gene: “We have each other, David. And maybe that’s enough, for now.”

They sit in silence for a while, watching the sun sink below the horizon. The world around them is quiet, still, and empty. But in their hearts, there is a small flame of hope that refuses to be extinguished.

Scene #4

As night falls, Gene and David come across an abandoned city. The buildings are crumbling and half-destroyed, but there is a sense of familiarity in the streets they walk down.

David: “Do you remember this place, Gene?”

Gene: “I think so. It was a city in Spain, before the war.”

David: “It’s strange, isn’t it? To see it like this.”

Gene: “Yes, it is. But it’s also a reminder of what we’ve lost. What we’ve allowed to happen.”

They walk through the empty streets, the sound of their footsteps echoing off the broken buildings. As they turn a corner, they see a small fire burning in the distance.

David: “Do you see that, Gene?”

Gene nods, and they approach cautiously. As they get closer, they see a figure sitting by the fire, huddled in a blanket.

Gene: “Hello? Are you okay?”

The figure looks up, startled. It’s an old man, his face lined with wrinkles.

Old Man: “Who are you? What do you want?”

Gene: “We mean you no harm. We’re just passing through.”

Old Man: “Passing through where? This city is dead.”

David: “We’re looking for companionship. For anyone else who might be left.”

Old Man: “Companionship? There’s no one left, except for me. And I’m too old to be anyone’s companion.”

Gene: “We understand. But please, can we rest by your fire for a while? We’ve been walking all day.”

The old man eyes them warily, but eventually nods. They sit down by the fire, the warmth of it comforting against the chill of the night.

As they sit in silence, Gene and David feel a sense of connection with the old man. They are all survivors in a world that has been destroyed, and in that shared experience, there is a glimmer of hope for companionship.

Scene #5

The next morning, Gene and David continue their journey through the abandoned city. They come across a hospital, the walls covered in graffiti and broken glass littering the ground.

David: “What do you think happened here?”

Gene: “I don’t know. But I imagine it was a place of great suffering.”

As they walk through the empty halls, they come across a room with a single bed. On the bed lies a young woman, her eyes closed.

Gene: “Is she…?”

David approaches the bed and checks her pulse.

David: “She’s alive, barely. We have to do something.”

They find a first aid kit and begin to tend to her wounds. She stirs and opens her eyes, looking up at them with confusion.

Woman: “Who… who are you?”

Gene: “We’re just passing through. We saw you and wanted to help.”

Woman: “Thank you. But why… why bother?”

David: “Because you’re human. And so are we.”

As they continue to care for her, the woman begins to open up to them. She tells them her name is Ana, and that she was a nurse in the hospital before the war. She had been on duty when the bombs fell, and had been left alone in the hospital ever since.

Ana: “I thought I was the only one left. It’s… it’s been so lonely.”

Gene: “You’re not alone, Ana. We’re here now.”

As they sit by her bedside, Gene, David, and Ana share stories of their lives before the war. It’s a small moment of companionship in a world that is otherwise devoid of it, but it’s enough to give them all a sense of hope for the future.

Scene #6

Gene, David, and Ana continue their journey through the ruined city, moving slowly and carefully. They come across a park, the grass overgrown and the trees bare.

David: “This is a beautiful park. It must have been wonderful before the war.”

Gene: “Yes, I imagine it was. But now…”

Ana: “Now it’s just a reminder of what we’ve lost.”

They sit on a bench, looking out at the desolate landscape. Suddenly, they hear a noise in the bushes.

David: “What was that?”

Gene stands up and cautiously approaches the bushes. He sees a small, frightened dog trapped in the thorns.

Gene: “It’s just a dog. It must have been wandering around here.”

David: “Can we help it?”

Gene carefully pulls the dog out of the bushes and checks it over for injuries. The dog seems to be unharmed, but is clearly frightened and in need of care.

Ana: “We can’t leave it here. We have to take it with us.”

Gene: “But what if it slows us down? What if it’s a burden?”

David: “It’s a life, Gene. And it needs our help.”

They decide to take the dog with them, and it becomes a constant companion on their journey. They name it Lucy.

As they walk through the ruined city, Gene, David, Ana, and Lucy form an unlikely family. They are all survivors in a world that has been destroyed, and in each other, they find a sense of companionship that helps to ease the existential loneliness they all feel.

Scene #7

As they continue their journey, Gene, David, Ana, and Lucy come across a small grocery store. The windows are boarded up, but they can see that there are still supplies inside.

David: “We need food and water. We should go in.”

Gene: “But what if there are others in there? What if it’s dangerous?”

Ana: “We have to take that risk. We need to survive.”

They cautiously enter the store, with Gene and David keeping watch while Ana and Lucy gather supplies. As they make their way through the aisles, they hear a noise from the back of the store.

Gene: “Did you hear that?”

David: “I think someone’s back there.”

They cautiously approach the source of the noise and find an old man hiding in the storage room.

Man: “Please… don’t hurt me.”

Gene: “We won’t hurt you. We’re just looking for supplies.”

Man: “I haven’t seen anyone in so long. I thought I was the only one left.”

Ana: “You’re not alone. We’re here.”

They share their supplies with the old man, who introduces himself as Miguel. He tells them that he used to work in the store before the war, and that he’s been living there ever since.

Miguel: “I’ve been surviving on canned goods and bottled water. I never thought I’d see fresh fruit again.”

Gene: “We’re all in this together, Miguel. We need to help each other if we’re going to survive.”

They invite Miguel to join them on their journey, and he agrees. With Miguel’s knowledge of the city, they are able to navigate their way more easily, finding shelter and supplies along the way.

As they continue on their journey, Gene, David, Ana, Lucy, and Miguel form a small community, bound together by their shared experience of surviving in a world that has been destroyed by war.

Scene #8

Gene, David, Ana, Lucy, and Miguel come across a partially collapsed building that seems to have been used as a hospital. They cautiously make their way inside, carefully avoiding the rubble.

As they move through the building, they hear a faint sound coming from one of the rooms. They cautiously approach the room and find a young girl lying on a bed, clearly very ill.

Ana: “We have to help her.”

Gene: “But we’re not doctors. We don’t know how to help her.”

Miguel: “I used to be a nurse. Let me see if I can do anything for her.”

Miguel examines the girl and determines that she is suffering from radiation sickness. He administers what limited treatment he can, but it’s clear that she needs more help than they can provide.

Miguel: “She needs to be in a hospital. But there’s no hospital left in this city.”

David: “We can’t just leave her here to die.”

Gene: “What choice do we have?”

Ana: “We can take her with us. We’ll take care of her.”

Miguel: “But we don’t have the supplies or equipment we need to keep her alive.”

Ana: “We’ll find a way. We’ll do whatever it takes.”

They carefully carry the girl out of the building and take her with them on their journey. Miguel does what he can to keep her comfortable, but it’s clear that her condition is worsening.

As they travel, they form a makeshift family, with the girl becoming a new member of their community. They do their best to care for her, knowing that her survival is uncertain in a world that has been destroyed by war.

Despite the bleakness of their situation, they find a sense of purpose in caring for each other, finding dignity and meaning in their struggle to survive in a world that has been stripped of all that was once familiar and comforting.

Scene #9

As Gene, David, Ana, Lucy, Miguel, and the young girl arrived in the town, they felt a sense of relief wash over them. The town was less devastated than others they had passed through on their journey, and they had high hopes for what they might find there.

As they walked down the main street, they passed by a small cafe with a sign that read “The Laughing Gargantuan.” They decided to stop and rest there for a while, and hopefully, they could find something to eat.

Inside the cafe, they found a group of people laughing and joking around a table. They hesitantly approached them and asked if they could join. The group welcomed them, and they sat down to rest and chat.

As they talked, they realized that these people were the first they had met who seemed to have not lost their sense of humor despite the dire situation they were in. They began to joke and make light of their situation, laughing at the absurdity of it all.

Day passed like a breeze,

Leaves rustling in peace.

Scene #10

As Gene, David, Ana, Lucy, and the young girl travel across the ruined landscape of Spain, they encounter others who are also struggling to survive, who have also experienced the horrors of war and destruction. They form a small community, sharing what little they have and offering each other comfort and support.

As time passes, the community grows, and they begin to rebuild, slowly but surely. They plant crops, gather water, and repair the damaged buildings. They work together, determined to create a new world, one that is founded on compassion and solidarity.

In the years that follow, the community thrives. They establish a school for the children, a hospital for the sick and injured, and a council to govern the community fairly and justly. They learn to live in harmony with the land, respecting its limits and caring for its fragile ecosystems.

David, after long time,
Fell into slumber’s sweet chime,
A dream surreal rose,
Ascending to unknown heights,
Strange visions it showed.

Scene #11 In ancient china city

In ancient China, there was a prosperous city named Qi. It was there that David(大卫) was born, the son of a humble merchant. David grew up learning the art of trade from his father and inherited his business after his father’s passing.

As he grew older, David became more successful and soon became one of the wealthiest merchants in all of Qi. He lived in a grand mansion, adorned with silk tapestries and fine porcelain. His wealth allowed him to indulge in lavish feasts and luxuries beyond the imagination of most.

Despite his success, David felt a nagging emptiness within him. He realized that the pursuit of wealth had left him feeling unfulfilled and that no amount of money could fill the void in his heart.

One day, while strolling through the bustling marketplace, David overheard a group of beggars lamenting their impoverished state. Moved by their plight, David began to question the purpose of his wealth.

He started to think about the people he could help and the good he could do with his fortune. Slowly but surely, he began to realize the futility of money and the temporary nature of material success.

Thus, David made the momentous decision to donate all of his wealth to the poor of Qi. His once grand mansion was turned into a shelter for the destitute, and he himself retired to a small cottage by a tranquil lake, where he spent his days fishing and enjoying the simple pleasures of life.

David had found the true meaning of happiness and contentment in life. Money could no longer control him or define his existence. He had discovered that the greatest wealth was the wealth of the heart.

Scene #12

Wealth, once deemed as wealth,
David found a fleeting state,
a passing affliction.

In giving all he had,
he found true joy and health,
an end to his addiction.

But rumors spread like fire,
his motives called into doubt,
his mind a twisted maze.

Yet David held his ground,
his decision brought relief,
the poor his rightful cause.

And when the needy came,
he welcomed them with open arms,
and found a purpose true.

Through his philanthropic call,
he inspired others to give,
to create a better world.

And so, the city changed,
a more equitable place,
where all could thrive and grow.

Scene #13

David, once a tycoon,
found contentment in a boon,
philanthropy his tune.

No more endless deals,
fishing by the lake, he feels
simple life, it heals.

But isolation fades,
he speaks up, no more charades,
a leader, accolades.

“Merchant with a heart,”
wise counsel, from near and far,
a sage, set apart.

Influence grows, yet he
knows that money cannot be
life’s priority.

He stays humble, true,
grateful for the simple view,
impact he can do.

Scene #14

As David grew older, his body began to slow down, and he found himself spending more time indoors, reflecting on his life and the lessons he had learned along the way.

Despite his advancing age, he remained active in his philanthropic endeavors, using his wealth and influence to support causes that were dear to his heart. He funded schools, hospitals, and community centers, and worked tirelessly to promote social justice and equality.

But as he looked back on his life, he also recognized that he had made mistakes along the way. He had been consumed by greed and ambition in his youth, and it had taken him many years to realize the futility of such pursuits.

And so, he began to write — essays and reflections on his life, his experiences, and the lessons he had learned. He poured his heart and soul into his writing, hoping that it would serve as a guide for future generations, a testament to the power of compassion and generosity in a world that often seemed consumed by greed and selfishness.

In his writing, he urged others to follow in his footsteps, to embrace a life of simplicity and meaning, and to use their wealth and privilege to help those less fortunate. He spoke of the joy and fulfillment that came from giving, and of the importance of living a life that was true to one’s values and beliefs.

His writing became widely read and admired, and he was hailed as a visionary by many. But for David, the true reward came from knowing that he had made a positive impact on the world around him, and that his legacy would live on long after he was gone.

And so, he continued to write and to give, cherishing the simple pleasures of life and the knowledge that he had lived a life of purpose and meaning.

Scene #15

As David approached the end of his life, he found himself at peace with the world around him. He had lived a long and fulfilling life, and had no regrets about the choices he had made along the way.

He spent his days fishing by the lake, enjoying the company of his loved ones, and reflecting on the many blessings that life had bestowed upon him.

David looked out over the lake and sang the following poem.

“Fleeting cherry blooms,
Life’s ephemeral beauty,
Gone with the spring breeze”

In the distance, like a faint memory that one can’t shake off, there emerges the figure of a fisherman named Wei, with a slow and measured gait, making his way towards David.
