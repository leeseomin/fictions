## A Fleeting Stroke or Temporal Eternity

### LEE SEOMIN (이서민)

A man, a solitary figure by the name of Elias, stood immobile before an
arresting sculpture. Carved with a disturbing acuity, it portrayed Zeus,
god of the sky, thunder, and lightning in Greek mythology, in the very
moment of unleashing his celestial wrath. His intended victim, a
meditating man seated beneath a tree, was depicted in the calm before
the storm.\
The visage of Zeus was a study in abstraction, a face fading into
obscurity, as if vanishing into the ether from which the Gods themselves
were born. His form was less a concrete entity, more a whisper of
divinity. He seemed to be not merely cast in bronze, but spun from
shadows and ancient lore, a specter etched into the fabric of reality.\
The imminent doom was palpable, imbued in the frozen tableau with such
intensity that it felt like the very next second --- no, the very next
millisecond --- would witness the meditator's immediate death by the
divine lightning bolt. The anticipatory terror was caught like a sigh
held breathless, a disaster pending in a moment's fragile silence.\
And there, rooted to the spot, was Elias, his gaze held captive by the
sculpture. A peculiar mixture of dread and fascination was etched on his
face as he dissected the narrative of this art piece. With every crease
and curve, with every suggestion of movement trapped in stillness, he
devoured the imminent catastrophe with an insatiable intellectual
hunger. He stood on the precipice of terror and beauty, the human
condition encapsulated in a moment of suspended chaos.\

The scene gradually receded, revealing an unexpected reality. It was as
if someone had grabbed the lens of the universe and pulled it backwards,
zooming out to reveal a grander design. The entire tableau, the tense
moment of chaos and order, Elias and the haunting sculpture, all existed
within a tiny, floating droplet.\
This droplet hung suspended in an expanse of nothingness, an inscrutable
vacuum that bore a semblance to the cosmos itself. Around it, countless
more droplets whirled, each carrying its own version of reality, each a
universe within itself. These tiny worlds danced like ethereal
constellations, forming a glistening matrix of realities that was as
beautiful as it was baffling.\
As they swirled in this cosmic ballet, they collided, merging and
mutating, just like the stories they contained. Droplets coalesced,
forming an ethereal cloud that seemed to hold the weight of an infinity
of narratives. It was a somber, silent dance of creation, where each
droplet was both a solitary world and a part of the grand cosmic
spectacle.\
The cloud grew, swelling under the burden of the droplets. Yet it was a
cloud born not of water but of untold stories, each pregnant with
anticipation, just like the sculpture Elias had been examining. As the
silent spectacle unfolded, one could not help but wonder at the mirage
that life is, captured in countless droplets of existence, each
reflecting a unique interpretation of reality.\

The cloud, swollen with countless tales and fantasies, could no longer
bear its weight. It ruptured with a silent sigh, and the rain began to
fall. Each drop was a universe weeping its tales onto a barren,
unresponsive landscape.\
Beneath this shower of narratives was an expanse of desert, as vast and
timeless as the cosmos itself. A lone figure sat cross-legged amid the
desolation, mirroring the meditating man under the thunderous gaze of
Zeus in Elias's observed sculpture. He welcomed the rain with
outstretched arms, his face tilted upwards, the drops of water
splattering onto his parched skin.\
The desert-man opened his eyes, revealing the ecstasy of a soul touched
by the divine. His joy was as profound and unfathomable as the universe
within each droplet. A smile spread across his face, a silent laughter
that echoed across the barren landscape, the raw joy of existence amidst
the indifference of the universe.\
And then, everything stopped. His smile, once a beacon of life in the
midst of the barren desert, was frozen in time, captured by an unseen
hand. As the observer had become the observed, Elias's gaze had been
replaced by that of a painter, scrutinizing the desert-man's joy with an
artist's critical eye.\

The painter, a man of nebulous name known as Luca, inspected the
desert-man's portrait, his face a tableau of dissatisfaction. His eyes
traced the curvature of the frozen smile, the joy captured like a
firefly in a jar, as vibrant as it was confined.\
Then, without warning, he thrust his brush onto the canvas. The
portrait, once a tribute to jubilance, was now marred with aggressive
strokes of black and crimson. Luca stood back, studying his creation
with a frown. Unfulfilled by the wreckage he had caused, he set the
canvas aflame.\
As the painting crackled and spit, embers soared into the sky, following
a path preordained by the cosmic dance. They lingered in the atmosphere,
waiting in the wings of time, like forgotten memories. The passage of
eons was but a breath to them.\
A celestial body, a rogue comet from the fringes of the cosmos, sought
union with the lingering embers. As they converged, they caused a
chemical explosion of such magnitude that it shattered the planet,
bringing forth a cataclysm that rivaled Zeus' divine wrath.\
This massive release of energy rippled through the cosmos. The universe,
unable to contain this energy, began to implode upon itself, a mirror to
Luca's creative and destructive caprice. It shrank, contracted, and
finally succumbed to its fate, evaporating into oblivion.\

In the aftermath of absolute silence, a faint stir began to take shape.
Out of the vast emptiness emerged a small, quiet world. It was a return
to the beginning, a cosmic rewind, the re-creation of existence in the
aftermath of its total annihilation.\
A man sat under a tree in deep contemplation. His face was marked by
wisdom, etched with countless epochs of unseen knowledge. This was the
same meditating man from the sculpture, reborn anew in the heart of this
fresh universe, the genesis and the symbol of life returned.\
Suddenly, his serene meditation was interrupted. He flinched, his eyes
snapping open as a mosquito pierced his skin, drawing blood with its
merciless bite. It was an event as insignificant as it was momentous, a
trivial annoyance that held a profound message --- life had persisted.\
In a universe where divine wrath could be encapsulated in a sculpture,
where countless realities could exist within droplets, and where a man's
joy could give way to cataclysmic destruction, it was this small
insect's feast that marked the true resilience of life. It was a
reminder that even in the face of grand chaos and immense peace, life,
with all its trivialities and grandeur, will always find a way.\
With this humble interruption, the man gave a faint smile, a knowing
acknowledgment of the beautiful absurdity of existence, as he returned
to his meditative state, welcoming this new era of existence. The cycle
had begun anew, an infinite loop of creation, destruction, and rebirth,
with life persisting, as resilient and tenacious as a mosquito's feast.\
